Before the contained Jupyter Notebook will work, the boston dataset for 2018 has to be added!
It can't be added to GitHub, because the file is about 250MB while GitHub only allows uploads up to 25MB. 

Required libraries in the Jupyter Notebook are numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, folium, sklearn and geopy.
